# BOPS Component Library

Welcome to the **BOPS (Back Office Planning System)** Storybook.

This is a visual catalogue of UI components used across BOPS, built on the
[GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

## How this works

The BOPS application is a Ruby on Rails app using **View Components**. Since
Storybook runs in the browser without Ruby, each story recreates the component's
HTML output so designers can see and interact with the UI.

## Organisation

Stories are grouped by area:

- **Core** — Foundational elements: banners, tags, error summaries
- **Content** — Text display components: formatted content, reviewer comments
- **Consultation** — Consultee-related UI: tables, responses, status lists
- **Planning Applications** — Application panels, search, status panels

## Design system

All components use the **GOV.UK Design System** with BOPS customisations:
- Font: **Open Sans** (not GDS Transport)
- Page width: **1100px** (wider than default 960px)
- Custom BOPS colours for branding accents
